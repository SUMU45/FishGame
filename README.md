# FishGame
This is an android project. For learning android i have created this game. To make this game I use android studio and Java.
In this game, I create a fish and three balls(yellow, green, red). The fish has three lives. If the fish touch green then it will score 20,
and if it touches the yellow ball it will score 10, but if it touches the red ball it will lose a life. After losing 3 life it will appear a screen and show the score and also 
show with a message that if the user wants to play this game again.
